<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
Every individual competes with others for the acquisition of Earthâ€™s resources. In a time of heightened environmental awareness, the preservation and protection of what we have left is of utmost importance. Instead of promoting competition for resources, we have decided to use competition to raise environmental awareness among individuals.
</p>
<h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>
	ENACt facilitates the creation and documentation of friendly competition among individuals, communities, and companies wanting to make a change in their local environment. Users of the site will be able to document and share their environmentally friendly actions whether it be for a challenge they are participating in or just for personal reasons.
</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>
	It all starts with the creating a free profile. Your profile will allow you to join challenges, create challenges, follow others with similar environmental interests, receive news specific to environmental issues that matter to you, and share your environmentally friendly actions with your followers. With each challenge you complete, each environmentally friendly action you record, or current challenge you are participating in, you will earn a prescribed number of points. The points earned are nothing more than a way of quantifying your activates with ENACt, and can be used as motivation to do more.
