<p>
	<b>Lowest Power Bill:</b> Bills can be a pain, so why not challenge others to see who can reduce their household electrical bill the most over a month. Compare the bill you received for the month of competition with the bill of the month prior to competition, and the largest difference wins.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Recycling Drive:</b>  Invite others to bring in their recyclable materials (cardboard, cans, glass bottles, or even car tires) to you. The group with the largest amount of recyclable materials collected after a week or month wins. Then go and recycle the collected material.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Carpool Challenge:</b> Our dependence on the use of personal vehicles has created a multitude of problems, so why not try and reduce our dependence of personal vehicles. Challenge various parts of your company to see which group can carpool to work the most. The group with the most carpool groups used over the workweek win.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Tree Planting:</b> Whether it be planting trees in your local forest or around your local park, challenge others to see who can plant the most trees within a given time frame. If funding is limited for your project, get the community involved and see how many trees you can have donated for your project. The more Trees the better.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Highway Clean Up:</b> Challenge other groups to spend the day cleaning up a highway or roadway nearest them. Put up signs that invite drivers to honk for one vote, the group with the most honks wins.
