<h3>BioNex</h3>

<h3>Trilogy Excursions</h3>
<p>
	Last year, Trilogy Excursions collected over one ton of marine trash floating around the waters of Maui County (Maui, Molokai, and Lanai). The group provides tourists with a boat and snorkel tour around reefs surrounding Maui, and invites their guest to collect as much marine trash as possible during their snorkeling tour.

	Trilogy Excursions continues with their original mission of cleaning up the reefs and waters of Maui County, and hopes to collect two tons of trash by the end of 2016.
