<h1>Profiles of the month</h1>
<p>
	Here is a collection of our favorite profiles this month. These profiles continue to contribute to environmental awareness, through their donation of various resources or participation in environmentally friendly acts.
</p>
<h3>Realty Juggler</h3>
<p>
	This past month Realty Juggler volunteered over 50 hours of community service at their communityâ€™s local park. The group helped remove litter, planted trees around the perimeter and inside the park, and helped install new recycling and trash receptacles throughout the park.

    Realty Juggler has two ongoing challenges including a bike to work challenge and a lowest power bill challenge. In the past Reality Juggler has participated in a total of seven challenges, and is always looking for another challenge.

<h3>BioNex</h3>
<p>
	Just last week, BioNex donated 30 large steel recycling bins to a local high school. The group saw a lack of recycling occurring in their local school district and decided they would help out. BioNex is currently participating in no challenges, but is eager to join one.

    BioNex is concerned with electronic recycling and water quality. In the past BioNex has participated in over 20 challenges.
</p>
<h3>Trilogy Excursions</h3>
<p>
	Last year, Trilogy Excursions collected over one ton of marine trash floating around the waters of Maui County (Maui, Molokai, and Lanai). The group provides tourists with a boat and snorkel tour around reefs surrounding Maui, and invites their guest to collect as much marine trash as possible during their snorkeling tour.

	Trilogy Excursions continues with their original mission of cleaning up the reefs and waters of Maui County, and hopes to collect two tons of trash by the end of 2016.
